# Strategy from reddit
#
# Keep a dictionary keyed by (score, position) which is your 'multiverse'. Populate it with score of 0 and starting position, mapping to the value of 1 (=state occurs 1 times)
# Starting from any position/score, you can end up in 7 different positions with 7 different scores, depending on the dice rolls.
# You need to iterate over all current states = dictionary key / values and create a new 'era', ie the next multiverse map. If at any point you achieve the target score, increase the win count for that era number. Otherwise, just add the current state counters to multiple new state counters
